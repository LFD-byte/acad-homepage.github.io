I am currently a visiting student at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), advised by Prof. [Imran Razzak](https://imranrazzak.github.io/) and Prof. [Bin Zhang](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/bin-zhang/). I recently graduated from East China Normal University with a master's degree in software engineering, where I was supervised by Prof. [Zhili Chen](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s43/czl2/main.psp). I completed my undergraduate studies at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Huaqiao University. 

My research interests include ai for biology, graph neural network and LLM. I have published several papers in conferences
